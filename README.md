**A native, GPU-accelerated terminal with the AI you actually want — and none of the lock-in.**

Inline command generation, an AI chat sidebar that reads your screen, and Warp-style command
blocks. **Local-first and bring-your-own-key** — one binary, no account, no Fangs cloud; point it at
your own API key or run a fully local model.

Fangs is a single local binary for **macOS and Linux**, built on Ghostty's
[`libghostty-vt`](https://libghostty.tip.ghostty.org/) terminal engine and rendered with
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). No account, no telemetry, no subscription.

## Why Fangs

Warp put genuinely useful AI in the terminal — then locked it behind an account, cloud telemetry,
and a subscription, and rendered its UI with non-standard TTY blocks. Fangs keeps the features and
drops the rest:

- **No account, no telemetry.** One local binary. You never sign in to use your own terminal.
- **Local-first & BYOK.** Fangs has no backend of its own — it connects straight from your machine
  to the endpoint *you* choose: Anthropic's native API, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or a
  **fully local** model via Ollama or llama.cpp. Your key lives on your disk, and scrollback is
  redacted on-device before anything is sent.
- **A real, standard terminal.** The VT layer is Ghostty's `libghostty-vt` — inspectable and
  community-maintained. Fangs never intercepts your shell's stdin to fake visual "blocks"; every AI
  feature is an overlay in the render pipeline, so the PTY byte stream stays pure.

## Features

- **AI chat sidebar** &nbsp;`Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+Shift+B` — ask about what's on your screen. Fangs
  captures recent scrollback (redacted for keys, tokens, and passwords *before* it leaves your
  machine), streams the answer live, and keeps multi-turn context. Any command in the reply gets a
  **Run** button that stages it at your prompt — never auto-executed.
- **Inline command generation** &nbsp;`Ctrl+Space` — describe what you want in plain language
  (*"undo last git commit"*) and get the command staged at your prompt, no trailing newline. You
  review and press Enter yourself, always.
- **Command blocks** &nbsp;Warp-style, via OSC 133 — once your shell emits the marks, each command
  gets a separator, a colored gutter, and a **✓ / ✗ exit-status badge**; hover to copy its output,
  and jump between commands with `Cmd+↑` / `Cmd+↓`. A pure render overlay — the byte stream stays
  untouched. (See [`docs/shell-integration.md`](docs/shell-integration.md).)
- **Live configuration** — an INI dotfile is the source of truth, with an in-app settings modal
  (`Ctrl+,`) that round-trips to it and hot-reloads instantly. No restarts.
- **First-class theming** — One Dark, Dark Modern, GitHub Dark, Gruvbox, Monokai, and light
  variants. Each themes the full 256-color palette in the engine, so *all* output is colored
  (`ls --color`, vim, prompts, 256-color apps), and the UI restyles to match.
- **Terminal essentials** — mouse selection with copy/paste (bracketed-paste safe),
  `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+click to open URLs, and `Ctrl+F` find-in-view.

## Install

### Quick install (macOS app, Linux CLI)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rene-rodriguez/fangs/main/install.sh | sh
```

Detects your OS and CPU, downloads the matching asset from the
[latest release](https://github.com/rene-rodriguez/fangs/releases/latest), and installs the
native launch target for your platform. macOS installs `Fangs.app` under `~/Applications`;
Linux installs the CLI under `~/.local` (`bin/fangs` plus the bundled `libghostty-vt`,
resolved via a relative RPATH).

| Option | How |
|---|---|
| Install the macOS app elsewhere | `curl … \| FANGS_APP_DIR=/Applications sh` |
| Force the CLI install on macOS | `curl … \| FANGS_INSTALL=cli sh` |
| Install the CLI to a custom prefix | `curl … \| FANGS_PREFIX=/usr/local sh` |
| Pin a specific version | `curl … \| FANGS_VERSION=v0.1.3 sh` |
| Authenticate a private mirror | `curl … \| FANGS_GITHUB_TOKEN=… sh` (also reads `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`) |

Until Developer ID signing is configured, the macOS app asset is published as an unsigned
tester zip. If macOS blocks the first launch, right-click `Fangs.app` and choose Open once.

Prebuilt targets: **Linux x86_64** and **macOS arm64** (Apple Silicon). **Intel Macs** and any other
target build from [source](#build-from-source) — the installer prints exactly how if no prebuilt
binary matches. Releases are built by CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) on every `v*` tag.

### Build from source

Requires **CMake 3.19+**, **Ninja**, a C compiler, and **libcurl**. Zig **0.15.2** compiles
`libghostty-vt` at build time, but you don't have to install it — the build scripts fetch the
pinned version into `vendor/` for you (`scripts/bootstrap-vendor.sh`, run automatically).

> **Zig version matters.** Fangs pins `libghostty-vt` to a commit that builds with Zig **0.15.2**.
> Arch/CachyOS `pacman` currently ships 0.16.0, which won't build the pin — so the scripts vendor
> 0.15.2 rather than relying on `PATH`. (Already have 0.15.2 on `PATH`? It's used as-is on Linux.)

```bash
# Linux / CachyOS — bootstraps Zig 0.15.2, then builds
sudo pacman -S --needed cmake ninja base-devel git curl
bash scripts/linux-build.sh
./build/fangs

# macOS — bootstraps Zig 0.15.2 + handles the Zig 0.15.2 ↔ macOS SDK workaround
bash scripts/macos-build.sh
./build/fangs
```

Rebuilds are incremental and fast: `cmake --build build` (after the first scripted build, the
vendored Zig and the FetchContent deps are cached).

- **Arch / CachyOS:** build a package straight from `packaging/aur/` (`makepkg -si`) — it fetches the
  pinned Zig for you. See [`packaging/aur/README.md`](packaging/aur/README.md).
- **macOS:** `scripts/macos-bundle.sh` produces a relocatable, self-contained `Fangs.app`
  (plus a distributable zip); a Homebrew **cask** lives in `packaging/macos/`. See
  [`packaging/macos/README.md`](packaging/macos/README.md).

## Keybindings

| Keys | Action |

| `Cmd+Shift+/` / `Ctrl+Shift+/` | Ask AI about the latest command block |
| `Cmd+↑` / `Cmd+↓` (or `Ctrl+↑` / `Ctrl+↓`) | Jump to previous / next command block |
| `Cmd+T` / `Ctrl+Shift+T` | New tab |
| `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+Shift+W` | Close focused pane (last pane closes the tab; last tab exits) |

| `Cmd+Shift+D` / `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+D` | Split focused pane down |
| `Cmd+Opt+←/→/↑/↓` / `Ctrl+Shift+←/→/↑/↓` | Move focus between panes |
| `Cmd` / `Ctrl` + `=` / `-` / `0` | Increase, decrease, or reset font size |

| `Ctrl` / `Cmd` + click a URL | Open it (`open` / `xdg-open`) |
| `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F` | Find — highlights matches in view (Esc closes) |

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.config/fangs/config` (INI), editable in-app via `Ctrl+,` (`Cmd+,` on
macOS). **Save** writes the file and hot-reloads live — font size resizes the grid, theme changes
apply instantly, no restart.

The AI features are **bring-your-own-key**: set the **`FANGS_API_KEY`** environment variable
(preferred), or store a key in the settings modal (written `0600`). When the env var is set, the
modal greys out the key field and shows *(from env)*. The key is never logged.

Pick your provider in the settings toggle:

- **anthropic** — the native Claude API (`x-api-key`, `/v1/messages`).
- **openai** / **ollama** / **custom** — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (hosted or local).

Switching the provider prefills a sensible default endpoint and model. Scrollback sent to the model
is run through a redaction pass first, terminal context is attached only to the current question,
and both the sidebar's Run buttons and inline generation stage commands without a newline — so you
always press Enter yourself.

tests/          config · layout · ui_sidebar_model · sse · redact · cmdextract · inline_cmd · theme · cmdblocks_osc  (ctest)

packaging/      aur/ (Arch · CachyOS) · macos/ (Homebrew cask)
docs/           plan.md · spec.md · shell-integration.md · handoff notes
```

Two narrow seams keep the project honest: `term_engine.h` wraps the VT engine
(`spawn / write / resize / render / dump_text`), and `ai_provider.h` wraps the AI transport
(`send(messages, on_token)`). Swapping the engine or a provider touches a single file.
